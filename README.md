CS 315 - Data Structures - 4 Units

This course introduces the concept of the organization of data into different structures to support the efficient implementation of computer algorithms.
The emphasis of the course is on the internal representation of the elementary and intermediate data structures such as stacks, queues, binary trees, heaps and hash tables, their time and space requirements, and their applications. A second component of the course is the study of more advanced features of object-oriented programming.
